# Animal Shelter Data Management in MEAN stack

This project is a volunteer tracking, scheduling, and animal status tracking application customized to the business needs of Luna's House in Maryland. It was originally deployed on Open Shift (v2) and that worked great. Then Red Hat decided to force migrate everything to v3 (or else) and that's been an utter misery so far.
